## Welcome to my GitHub Page

Here I will upload different projects. I am currently studying front-end development, with HTML, CSS and JS. I'm also interested in python, there are many uses I find for this language. As I'm a beginner I'm trying to learn Pygame and Kivy to make cross-platform games so I can get used to programming in python.
